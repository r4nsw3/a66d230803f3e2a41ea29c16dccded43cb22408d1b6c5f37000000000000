  |   Steamburg is an award-winning puzzle adventure game with story        |
  |   exploration elements and unique gameplay. The game is made by         |
  |   Telehorse, a steampunk games company. It was awarded the Best         |
  |   Upcoming Game at IMGA in San Francisco in March 2017.                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The main character, professor Vincent Cornelius Moore, fights         |
  |   robots that invaded the city of Steamburg. The gameplay is unique -   |
  |   Vincent is unarmed, so he must choose his moves wisely. He can only   |
  |   throw small electro-bombs which lure the robots and halt their        |
  |   progress for a while. Vincent has to walk through the streets in      |
  |   such a way that the robot chasing him hits upon a Tesla coil and is   |
  |   destroyed. It seems quite easy in the first levels. Then you have     |
  |   to fight several robots at the same time, the robots become faster    |
  |   and faster, some of them can fly and other respond to Vincent's       |
  |   every move.                                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Narrative elements are of great importance. In 2016 Steamburg won     |
  |   an award for Best Storytelling at White Nights in Helsinki.           |
  |   Dialogues reveal Vincent to be a scientist responsible for testing    |
  |   a new weapon in Steamburg. At the same time he is searching for his   |
  |   fiancée who was reported to be in Steamburg when the robots           |
  |   attacked. Some narrative elements are connected directly with the     |
  |   gameplay. Players can also find many letters and photos and           |
  |   discover the love story of Vincent and his fiancée.                   |
